## Welcome
This tab gives a brief explanation of my choosen data set and gives a random sample from the data. The sample gives the demographic category and its grouping, the drug, and the usage rate for that drug by group demographic. The specific demographic and the correlating group is shown in this table. This page alsoo specifies that the data was taken in 2015.
## Bar Graph 
This tab has a bar graph in the main panel that uses a selected age range, choosen from an input widget, to give the usage rate for each substance for the selected variable. The usage percentages are shown in the y axis, and are adjusted to accomodate for the scale of the usage rates. There are five columns for each substance in the dataset. We are able to change the graph visually by adding the usage rate value % of each drug to the top of all the bars. We are able to change whether we view these values or not using a select input widget. The maximum usage rate is given at the top of the graph, and changes for each selection.
## Table
This data table gives the highest and lowest usage rate per demographic by each drug. The main panel has the data table, and the side panel has a widget that allows the user to select what substance to adjust the data table to. The maximum usage rate is given at the top of the graph, and changes for each selection. By comparing each demographic group, you can see what substance has the greatest and lowest usage amongst the each demographic, giving an insight into who is using these substances.
